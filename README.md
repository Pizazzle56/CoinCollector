# CoinCollector
My First LibGDX game. 

Coin Collector is a game intended for me to begin to understand the powerful LibGDX library which can be used for a variety of game related development in the java language. The code in this project is terrible and shouldn't be used as a reference for any reason, as it probably promotes bad practices.
